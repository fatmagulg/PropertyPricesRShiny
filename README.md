# PropertyPricesRShiny
EDA, GAM, and RShiny app exploring property prices in England

The aim of this assignment is to develop a model for property price against select covariates for the county Wrexham, England and to 
produce an RShiny app to for users to see exploratory plots of relationships between selected variables, calculate the predicted price
of their property in Wrexham given their inputs of covariate, and calculate the predicted price of their property after renovations e.g.
adding an extension or improving insulation. The latter two are based on the model developed in the first R script. 

The data is the csv file named 'WREXHAM.csv'. Before running the Shiny app, make sure to have the dataset saved in the same folder and set as the working directory!
